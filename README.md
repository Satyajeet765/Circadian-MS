Statistical analysis
To access if the temporal rhythms of mRNA expression showed an olfactory sensitivity to ecologically
relevant volatile odorants a repeated measure ANOVA was carried out using dose and time as
predictors in the model where individual identity of the mosquito (ID) was nested in dose for the
two mosquito species. To conduct a comparative analysis between the two species a similar analysis
was carried out as above while adding species identity as an additional predictor. If the time of day
or its interaction terms were found to influence the antennal sensitivity a one-way ANOVA (within
single species differences) or two-way ANOVA (between two species differences) followed by post
hoc Tukey HSD test between the zeitgeber time points at each concentration of the volatile odorant
(dose) was performed. All the mentioned analyses were conducted using the software R (version
4.3.1).
